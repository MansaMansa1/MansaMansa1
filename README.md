# Hi, I'm Keith Emanzi 👨🏾‍💻

I'm a pragmatic builder who thrives on solving real problems with clean code and sharp workflows.  
Whether it's debugging a stubborn blank page or automating a tedious task, I get it done.

## 🔧 What I Work With
- 🖥️ Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ⚙️ Back-end: Python, Flask
- 🛠️ Tools: VS Code, GitHub, Bash

## 🚀 Projects in Progress
- Personal website (built from scratch, no templates)
- Automation scripts for daily workflows
- Visa appointment system tracker refresher automated (because bureaucracy needs debugging too)

## 🧩 How I Work
- Persistent, methodical, and allergic to vague advice
- Learn by doing, fix by iterating
- Always optimizing—code, tools, and life
